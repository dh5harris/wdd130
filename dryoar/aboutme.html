      <h2>Daniel Harris</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Daniel. I am working toward a B.S. in Applied Technology.
        Some of things I like to do when I have time are hiking, camping, and
        fishing. I married my bride, Kristy, in the Nashville temple. We have
        two daughters together. I have two older daughters from a previous
        marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been working as a career firefighter for the last 23 years. I am
        retiring from the fire service this year. Now that I have grown up, I am
        pursuing a second career in computer programming. I am grateful for the
        opportunity to pursue my education through BYU-Pathways and BYU-Idaho.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been a member of the church for all my life. My parents are both
        converts to the church. Since pursuing my education, one of my favorite
        scriptures has been James 1:5, "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask
        of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it
        shall be given him." It reminds me to always ask Heavenly Father for His
        help to learn and remember all things.
