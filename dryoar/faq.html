            Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?
          </h2>
          <p class="faq-paragraph-1">
            Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have
            found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more
            overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are
            all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their
            children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time.
            Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The
            areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the
            world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not
            to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat
            also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river
            guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling
            stories...some of which are even true!

            Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I
            still come?
          </h2>
          <p class="faq-paragraph-2">
            TAs with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed
            element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all
            certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3
            years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns
            and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on commercial rafting
            trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation
            device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great
            time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk
            before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and
            do in the event that you fall out of the raft.
          </p>
          <h2 class="faq-headline-3">What is included in the trip?</h2>
          <p class="faq-paragraph-3">
            We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a
            sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day
            bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair. We provided
            water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are
            provided during the morning and evening hours. You may bring beer,
            liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). You
            may purchase these items either the night before the trip, or on
            your way to the put-in. 3 meals per day, plus snacks.

            What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?
          </h2>
          <p class="faq-paragraph-5">
            Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater
            rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the river. Arise in the
            soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a
            beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh
            blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and
            prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of
            swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and
            more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up
            your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the
            river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your
            dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled
            salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven
            brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be
            able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to
            bed under more stars than you thought were possible.

            <h2>How far in advance should I book my trip?</h2>
            <p>
              If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year
              in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is
              usually sufficient.
