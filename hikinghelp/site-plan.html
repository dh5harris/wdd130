      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        I want you to think back to the last time you went hiking or even the
        first time. How did it go? Did it go smoothly? What things did you
        forget? Were there things you wish you had known before you started or
        knew of any resources that could help you prepare? Even if you are
        wanting to go hiking for the first time or a seasoned veteran. Look no
        further than hikinghelp.com. Hikinghelp.com is the place to go to find
        the resources you need from planning, to trail conditions, to trail and
        gear reviews, to instructional articles and videos. We have all the help
        you need for hiking. Even if you are an experienced hiker, we want you
        to come and share your wisdom, experiences, and stories with everyone so
        they can learn from you. Come check us out at hikinghelp.com

      <h2>Style Guide</h2>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL:
      <a
        href="https://coolors.co/335145-cc7700-ffd61f-0e67b4-cc5200"
        target="_blank"

        <tr>
          <th>Primary</th>
          <th>Secondary</th>
          <th>Accent 1</th>
          <th>Accent 2</th>
        </tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->

          <td class="accent2">#0E67B4</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Merriweather
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Merriweather works well for headings, gives a good visual impact, and is
        easy to read.
        <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Open Sans
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Open Sans is easy to read font for all screens and works well for the
        paragraphs and body of the website.
        <!-- change this -->

      <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
      <p>

      <h3>Resources</h3>
      <p>
        Trails With so many trails nearby, you don’t have to go far to find one.
        There are several in Land Between the Lakes (LBL) here in Kentucky.
        There is the Canal Loop, The North/South trail, and a few others. There
        are even more in southern Illinois. They are fairly easy to get to and
        hike. “How to” Resources We have several articles and videos on how to
        use the gear that you might want to learn about. How and way do you want
        to use hiking/trekking poles? Why and how do you use water purification
        for when you need to refill on water? Before you go You think you can
        just go and get on the trail. There are some things you should consider.
        What items do you need to take with you, even on a short hike? Planning
        on where you are going is a great idea. Is it an easy or a hard trail?
        How long it will take you to hike the trail you are planning to hike.
        Don’t forget about the weather. It can change on you quickly. So be
        prepared.
